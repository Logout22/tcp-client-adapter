tcp client adapter
==================

A small tool to connect two clients without an intermediate server,
e.g. a passive VNC server to an ordinary VNC client instead of a
listening viewer.

------------     ---------------------------------     ------------
||        ||     ||        -------------        ||     ||        ||
|| Client || --> || Server |   <--->   | Server || <-- || Client ||
||        || <-- || socket |    TCA    | socket || --> ||        ||
------------     ||        |           |        ||     ------------
                 ||        -------------        ||
                 ---------------------------------

For instance, I like to use KRDC, which is a feature-rich
VNC client with the ability to scale the server's resolution.
However, it provides no mode for a listening VNC viewer, so I made
this little tool to fill the gap.

It is written in C and so far designed for UNIX systems only.

Refer to INSTALL for an explanation of the standard GNU build process
that this program adheres to.
On the 'dev' or 'sketch' branches, do not forget to run:

    autoreconf -iv

before the first run of configure and whenever you changed
either configure.ac or Makefile.am.
